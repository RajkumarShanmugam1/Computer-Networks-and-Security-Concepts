# File Transer Protocol

- File transfer protocol server (commonly known as FTP Server) is computer software that facilitates the secure exchange of files over a TCP/IP network. It runs the file transfer protocol (FTP), a standard communication protocol that operates at the network level, to establish a secure connection between the devices in a client-server architecture and efficiently transmit data over the internet.

## What are the types of FTP?
### The following are common types of FTP :
- FTP Secure (FTPS): Taking security one notch up from traditional FTP, FTP Secure (FTPS) ensures a secure file transfer. It provides an additional encryption layer using either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols during data transmission across the network.
- SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP): This is a secure file transfer subsystem for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. SFTP is a widely used method for securely transferring files over remote systems. In SFTP, both data and commands are encrypted and transmitted in specifically formatted binary packets through a single, secured connection using SSH.
