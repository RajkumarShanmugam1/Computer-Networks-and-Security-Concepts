- A concurrent server accepts a client connection, delegates the connection to a child process of some kind, and immediately signals its availability to receive the next client connection.

- Full-duplex data transmission means that data can be transmitted in both directions on a signal carrier at the same time. For example, on a local area network with a technology that has full-duplex transmission, one workstation can be sending data on the line while another workstation is receiving data.
