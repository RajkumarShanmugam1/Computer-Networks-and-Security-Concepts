# Dijkstra algorithm

- Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between a given node (which is called the "source node") and all other nodes in a graph. This algorithm uses the weights of the edges to find the path that minimizes the total distance (weight) between the source node and all other nodes
- The distance between the vertices can be calculated by using the below formula: d(x, y) = d(x) + c(x, y) < d(y) = (0 + 4) < ∞ = 4 < ∞
