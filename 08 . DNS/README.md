# Domain Name System (DNS)

- The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.
- Reverse the ip address from domain name.

- DNS cache refers to the temporary storage of information about previous DNS lookups on a machine's OS or web browser. 
- Keeping a local copy of a DNS lookup allows your OS or browser to quickly retrieve it and thus a website's URL can be resolved to its corresponding IP much more efficiently.
