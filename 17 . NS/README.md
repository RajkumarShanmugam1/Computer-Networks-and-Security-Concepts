# Network Simulator

- Simulation is the process of learning by doing. Whenever there is something new in the world, we try to analyze it first by examining it and in the process get to learn a lot of things.
- Network simulation (NS) is one of the types of simulation, which is used to simulate the networks such as in MANETs, VANETs, etc.
- It provides simulation for routing and multicast protocols for both wired and wireless networks.
- NS is licensed for use under version 2 of the GNU (General Public License) and is popularly known as NS2. 
- It is an object-oriented, discrete event-driven simulator written in C++ and Otcl/Tcl.
